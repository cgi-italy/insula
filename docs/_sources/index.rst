Insula Documentation
=====================

The following pages provide a guidance to the Insula's services and capabilities.

We suggest starting with the :ref:`intro` and then right away with :ref:`getting_started` !

You may also find it useful to refer to:

* The list of :ref:`faq`.
* The list of :ref:`known_issues`.

.. note::

   If none of these pages answer your question, then please contact us at insula-ops.it@cgi.com.
